# TrinityFlow - Additions Beyond GDD

This document lists all features and improvements added to TrinityFlow that were not specified in the original Game Design Document (GDD.txt).

## Camera System
- **Shoulder Camera View**: Implemented over-the-shoulder camera positioning
  - Camera offset: 80 units right, 60 units up
  - Distance: 300 units from character
  - Added camera lag for smooth movement
  - Position and rotation lag for natural feel

## HUD Improvements

### Enemy Information Display
- **Floating Info Panels**: Enemy information displays above their heads instead of aim-based targeting
  - Shows: Name, Health bar, HP values, Attack/Defense stats, Tags, States, Mark duration
  - Constant size regardless of distance
  - Text shadows for readability without background
  - Only displays for enemies on screen

### Floating Damage Numbers
- **Damage Feedback System**: Shows actual damage dealt above enemies
  - Yellow numbers for direct damage
  - Purple "ECHO XX" numbers for echo damage
  - Numbers float upward and fade over 2 seconds
  - Size scales with damage amount
  - Random horizontal offset for multiple hits

### Visual Enhancements
- **No Background UI**: Removed black backgrounds from UI elements
  - Added text shadows for readability
  - Cleaner, less intrusive interface
  - Health bars have thin black outlines

## Combat System Enhancements

### Defensive Abilities Fix
- **Proper Timing Windows**: Fixed defensive ability system
  - Enemies no longer instantly damage players
  - 1.5 second window to use defensive abilities
  - Visual feedback for timing windows (Orange = Moderate, Green = Perfect)
  - Proper damage reduction and bonus effects

### Echo Damage Calculation Fix
- **Accurate Echo Damage**: Fixed to match GDD specification
  - Echo damage correctly calculated as 75% of actual health lost
  - Accounts for soul damage 2x multiplier
  - Works with both physical and soul damage sources

### Attack Indicators
- **Enhanced Enemy Attack Visuals**:
  - Attack lines start from enemy head position (150 units up)
  - Color-coded timing windows:
    - Orange (0-0.75s): Moderate defense window
    - Green (0.75-1.5s): Perfect defense window
  - Growing line thickness to show attack progress
  - Text indicators ("MODERATE" / "PERFECT!")
  - Green sphere effect during perfect window

## Debug Features

### Comprehensive Logging
- Added debug logging for:
  - Enemy registration
  - Damage events
  - Echo damage processing
  - Ability usage
  - Defensive ability timing

### Visual Debug Elements
- Attack line indicators with color coding
- Echo damage connection lines (purple)
- Damage calculation logging

## Code Architecture Improvements

### Event System
- **Damage Event Broadcasting**: 
  - OnDamageDealt delegate includes actual damage dealt
  - Proper event registration for spawned enemies
  - HUD subscribes to damage events for floating numbers

### Component Communication
- **Weapon-Player Integration**: 
  - Weapons properly access player's AbilityComponent
  - Fixed component ownership issues
  - Proper initialization order with delayed registration

## Quality of Life Features

1. **Always Visible Enemy Info**: No need to aim at enemies to see their stats
2. **Clear Damage Feedback**: See exactly how much damage each attack deals
3. **Visual Timing Guides**: Clear indication of when to use defensive abilities
4. **Improved Readability**: All text has shadows for visibility on any background

## Technical Fixes

1. **Delegate Binding**: Fixed crashes from early delegate binding
2. **Component References**: Proper component sharing between weapons and player
3. **Collision Detection**: Improved enemy targeting with visibility channel
4. **Distance Scaling**: UI elements maintain consistent size

## Setup and Documentation

- **SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Comprehensive setup guide for the project
- **Clear Code Organization**: Maintained clean separation of concerns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Easy to extend and modify
