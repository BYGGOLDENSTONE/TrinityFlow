damage calculation:
	physical damage calculated as attackpoint * (100 - defencepoint)% = value of should decreased from health. example: 10 attack point character2 attacks to character1 who has 20 defence point and 100 health, ---> 10 * (100 - 20)% = 8 so after attack character1's health drops to 92. 
	soul damage calculated as  attackpoint * 2 = value of should decreased from health. example: 20 attack point character2 attacks to character1 who has 70 defence point and 200 health, ---> 20 * 2 = 40 so after attack character1's health drops to 160. this will be same if the character1 has shield soul damage is bypass armor and shield.

gameplay loop: 
	player uses abilities on combat and can change weapons during combat. when player is non-combat state space key is for jumping but when player in combat state then space key is for defensive abilities and cant use jump ability. for echoes of data ability, example usage: player use this ability to enemy1 who has high agility then start to hit enemy2 with anything this damage can be physical or soul doesnt matter then enemy1 also take soul damages equivalent to enemy2 receives but 75% of it (30% for AoE). if marked enemy dies first nothing happens because this ability mainly uses for not easy to catch enemy.
